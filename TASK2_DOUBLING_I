In order to double the current, we can simply put two mosfets of the same parameters in parallel.

"Theoretically", we already showed that the mosfet acts as a current source. 
	Two current sources of the same value in parallel will obviously produce
	a current that is the sum of their individual values.

In physics terms, this is no different than modifying W/L to have twice the width.

IMPORTANT: We must change the added voltage source (V1) to cover the additional voltage drop across the load;
	If we do not then the device will not remain in saturation.

|* New V1 Value: 10.125*2 + 4.5 = 24.75V minimum. Choose 25v.
